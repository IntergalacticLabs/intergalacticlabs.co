Finding a good map of Mars is no easy task.  There’s [one really good map from NASA](http://marstrek.jpl.nasa.gov/), but it doesn’t show up on the first page of google results for "map of mars."  The first thing you’ll notice is that there are a lot of red/green/blue topographical maps like the one pictured below.  The reds are the high elevations, and the blue the low elevations.  The maps are cool and interesting, but they don’t really answer a lot of the questions you have about Mars.

**It’s kind of like trying to picture the earth like this:**

Topo maps are obviously not the ideal way to picture Earth or Mars in your head.  But it is a good enough start.  From the topographical map, we can start identifying regions and orienting ourselves on an otherwise uniformly dusty planet.  Without oceans and continents, we have to rely on highlands and lowlands and massive craters to delineate Martian territories.  We can see immediately that the lowest altitude region on Mars is the big blue crater (Hellas Basin).  It’s important to know the lowest spot on Mars because we know that low altitude means higher atmospheric pressure, so that we can deduce that this large deep blue crater is a prime candidate for early human colonies.

If we want to really dig in and explore the features of Mars, NASA has a really awesome and surprisingly modern web map, Mars Trek ([http://marstrek.jpl.nasa.gov/#](http://marstrek.jpl.nasa.gov/#)).  There’s lots of quality science and geology layers to explore on this map.  You should definitely go through the little tour they offer in order to figure out how to add the features you're interested in.

NASA goes the extra mile to make Mars fun for regular people.  For instance, they have plotted the path taken during the film The Martian for us to see (it’s in the bookmarks tab, right [here](http://marstrek.jpl.nasa.gov/#v=0.1&x=-6.32&y=14.17&z=4&p=IAU2000%3A49900&d=&l=nomenclature_eq%2Ctrue&l=graticule_eq%2Cfalse&l=nomenclature_np%2Ctrue&l=graticule_np%2Cfalse&l=nomenclature_sp%2Ctrue&l=graticule_sp%2Cfalse&l=MC11E_HRMOSCO_COL%2Ctrue&l=HRSC_Martian_east%2Ctrue&l=ESP_040776_2115_RED_A_01_ORTHO%2Ctrue&l=ESP_042252_1930_RED_B_01_ORTHO%2Ctrue&l=ESP_042647_1760_RED_B_01_ORTHO%2Ctrue&l=martian_path%2Ctrue&l=martian_waypoints%2Ctrue)).  It would be great if they could color-match the high-res light brown image tiles, but it’s a cool map nonetheless.

Next we’ll go through some of the lower quality maps of Mars on the web, but maps you still might be interested in if you’re a hard core Mars nerd.

![USGS Mars map](/images/image_4.png)

USGS is the governmental body that is officially in charge of planetary maps, so they have their own map of Mars ([http://webgis2.wr.usgs.gov/Mars_Global_GIS/](http://webgis2.wr.usgs.gov/Mars_Global_GIS/)).  The problem is that it’s not made for regular people like you and me, it’s made by engineers and scientists for engineers and scientists.  It might be a little outdated, though.  We’ve come a long way in web maps in recent years.

![Google Mars map](/images/image_5.png)

Google provides a topographical map that has little markers all over it.  It gives you a little more insight into where specific things are on Mars, but really doesn’t get anywhere near a good earth map.  Regions are represented as points, which is kind of weird.

![Stamen Mars map](/images/image_6.png)

Stamen is a good modern web mapping group.  They have an interesting Tron-esque 3D contour map of Mars.  [http://maps.stamen.com/mars](http://maps.stamen.com/mars/#6/-2.175/-46.956/0/-600/750/0.785).  This is a really cool view of the mountains and canyons on Mars, but doesn’t really achieve much beyond the "wow" factor.

We hope you liked our introduction to modern maps of Mars!  We think that there's a lot of progress being made in mapping right now, and we’re excited to release our own Mars map to the public sometime this year.  Stay tuned!
