Intergalactic Labs has created a [community for space exploration discussion](https://intergalacticlabs.slack.com) on the chat platform Slack.  You can join the group just by submitting your email below. We won't save your email for future use or send you any email other than this invitation, ever.

<div class="row">
  <form class="invite six columns" onsubmit="return invite()">
    <input class="u-full-width" id="invite-email" type="email" placeholder="Email">
    <button class="u-full-width" id="invite-send" type="submit">Get Invite</button>
  </form>
</div>


Itâ€™s completely free and anyone can join.  There are specific chat channels for mars, the moon, and a lot of other interesting topics already, but please feel free to create a new channel for any topic you find interesting! Just make sure the topic is not too narrow and not too broad :)

See you there!  Make sure to say hi to everyone in the #general channel!
